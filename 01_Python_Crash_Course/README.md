This repository directory contains notebooks for a rapid introduction to to Python language essentialls for data science/scientific programming. A large part of the material was adopted from [*A Whirlwind Tour of Python*](http://www.oreilly.com/programming/free/a-whirlwind-tour-of-python.csp) book (free [100-page pdf](http://www.oreilly.com/programming/free/files/a-whirlwind-tour-of-python.pdf)), which also has a designated [repository](https://github.com/jakevdp/WhirlwindTourOfPython).

For more info, you may also be interested looking at the [*The Python Data Science Handbook*](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920034919.do) (also with notebooks [on github](https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook)).

The code was written and tested using **Python 3.7**, and should work for any Python 3.X
version.
